## ADH-Do

This project is a **planner-style habit formation app** designed specifically for individuals with **ADHD**, addressing the unique challanges they face in forming and maintaining habitats. Since **dopamine regulation** plays a crucial role in habit- building difficulties, this app introduces **gamification elements** to make daily task completion more engaging and rewarding.

## Features

- **Guild Systems** - Users can join **guilds** and compete against each other for motivatin.
- **Task-based Rewards** - Completeing tasks on a **to-do list** earns users **coins**.
- **Push Notifications** - Push notifications when user hasn't used the app in a while to encourage user **not to quit**.
- **Accessibility features** - Designed with **colorblind-friendly UI** and **dyslexic friendly fonts** for inclusivity.
- **Smart Planner** - A structured planner to **track daily habits and goals**.
- **Dopamine-driven Engagement** - Digital **awards and milestones** reinforce habit formation.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native/Expo-Typescript
- **Backend**: Firebase-javascript
- **Database**: Firebase-Javascript
- **Development Enviornment**: VS Code

## Why this App?

People with ADHD often struggle with **habit formation** due to difficulties with **dopamine regulation**. By leveraging **gamification, social accountability, and structured planning**, this app provides the **necessary motivation** to develop and maintain consistent routines. Traditional habit-tracking apps often **fail** to adress these challanges in a way that keeps users engaged.
Our app is designed to **bridge this gap** by leveraging
- **Gamification**
- **Social Planning**
- **Structured Planning**<br>
We believe this **innovative approach** sets our apart from existing solutions because we have backed our design with **research on ADHD motivation strategies**. Our focus on **Dopamine-driven engagement** and **community support** ensures that users stay **motivated, accountable, and consistent** in building habits.

### Key Metrics to Track:

1. **Daily Task Completion Rate** - How consistently users complete tasks.
2. **Engagements levels** - How frequently users interact with the app (e.g., logging tasks, sending notifications).
3. **Retention Rate** - How many users continue using the app over time.
4. **Social Engagement** - Frequency of interactions within **guilds**.

## How 
**Planning phase** 
- Definded the core features of the app.
- Establlished the base structure and decided on key technologies(firebase, react native, etc).

**Backend & Database** 
 - Developed the database structure in Firebase to store user data, tasks, and guild information.
- Ensured that the database supports real-time updates for seamless interaction.

**UI & Feature Feasability Check**
- Designed a colorblind-friendly UI that is both intuitive and accessible.
- Assessed which features could be implemented within the available timeframe.

**Frontend & Backend Development**
- Built the frontend with task management, guild interactions, and notifications.
- Developed the backend API to handle authentication, task updates, and reward distribution.

**Integration & Testing**
- Connected the frontend and vackend to ensure smooth data flow.
- Tested ffeatures like push notifications, task tracking, and reward systems.

## Future Prospects
Our main goal for future development is to implement features that we could not complete within the initial time frame. These enhancements would further improve engagement, motivation and accessibility for useres with ADHD.<br>
**Planned Features**:
- **Idle Game Integration** - A reward based mini-game to provide additional dopamine boosts for completing tasks.
- **Location-Based Notifications** - Smart reminders triggered when users are near specific locations.
- **Reminder Animal** - A virtual companion that encourages users to stay on track with their habits.
- **Screen Time Controls** - Options to limit distractions and improve focus (if possible).

**Long-Term Vision**:<br>
- **Therapist & healthcare Integration** - Enable professionals to use the app as a support tool for ADHD patients.
- **Advance Habit Tracking and Insights** - Provide users and professionals with detailed progress reports to analyze habit formation patterns.
- **Community Features** - Expand the guild system with public challanges, social encouragement, and collaberative goal-setting.
<br> <br>
By expanding these features, we aim to creat a tool that not only helps individuals but also serves as a valuable resource for therapists and professionals working with ADHD.
